GIGAMAP 0.2 CHANGELOG
============================================	
+ Brand new bathymetry layer and an optional height map
+ Sea colours have been moved to a simple colour pallette 
+ Reworked Tibetan Tusi (kingdoms, chiefdoms, etc) to be as accurate as possible
+ Reworked Alternative Land layer to include inner colours to allow easier filling in
+ A heap of tiny corrections to the map (unfilled land, Bouvet island not being filled, etc.)
+ Improved organisation of the alternative layers
+ Alternative lands moved to a separate file apart from the main file
+ Further modifications to the modern administrative map, adding many first and econd level administrative subdivisions (still not complete however)
 - USA COUNTIES ARE NOW FINISHED
+ A whole heap of new borders in China, parts of India and Mongolia (Republic of China's counties and municipalities are still WIP)
+ THE INDIAN PRINCELY STATES HAVE BEEN FULLY REDRAWN
+ All layers have been taken out of the gigamap files and organised into their respective folder (to stop from your craptops bricking when trying to run it)
+ The German Confederation borders have been finally redrawn to include as many exclaves as possible (to be as accurate and annoying to draw)
+ New islands that have been accidentally ommitted (such as Linosa island south of sicily)
+ A whole heap of new Insulindian sultanates and borders have been added (hooray for new irrelevant kingdoms)
+ Africa has seen a large increase in borders added
+ Redrawn Yemeni states
+ Merged the TNO borders with the main province map

	- Late Holy Roman Empire borders (1789)
	- More variants of territorial evolution of Iran
	- Borders of some /really/ weird seperatist movements in Italy (Adriatica, Padania, etc)
