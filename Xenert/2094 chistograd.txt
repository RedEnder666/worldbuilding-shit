The year is 2094. 15 years since the world fell silent.
Scout Boynak Ender, the man whose voice came from every terminal of the bunker, who voiced the OS of the bunkers. The man who filmed the flash, the mushroom-shaped cloud... and survived... opens the doors to Chistograd bunker - under the cold ruins of the second biggest city of former USCE.
Smell. The smell of mold, moist, death...
Nearly impossible to breath. Everything is covered in 2 cm layer of mold... it's everywhere - walls, floor,Â  ceiling... they choked to death because their own ventillation was infected...
They built 10 bunkers. Each for 25 thousands of people. It's the most they could do. It was the best they could offer. They spent a decade planning and building them. Spent half the resources of the union. 
Everything was in the pragmatic, real style of USCE. "Union of Societist Communes of Entantha". Society made of trauma and scars. No elites, no politicians. They saved people. They tried. They wanted. They really did have a plan. Not for the state, but for some people.
There are now 3 bunkers confirmed dead.
