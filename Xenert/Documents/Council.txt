The Anarcho-Cooperativist Party (ACP) (24 seats – Largest Bloc)
Ideology: "No gods, no masters, especially no centralized bureaucrats."
Irony: The biggest party actively works to make sure nobody rules.
Real Power: They’re the reason the Commons Board can’t become a traditional state and stays mostly a lawmaker, and, rarely, an edge-case temporary ruler.
They don’t want to govern—they’re just here to veto any attempt at centralization.
Most Extreme goal: Dissolve the Commons Board, replace it with public accountability and aid networks via constructive change within the framework they helped build.

Democratic-Societist (DSP) + Socialist Democratic (SDP) Coalition  (12 + 12 = 24 seats)
Ideology: "Art, drugs, and vibes are human rights."
Role: Ensures cultural production gets funding, artists get points, and nobody gets purged for being weird.
Most Extreme goal: Uh... none, they're pretty moderate actually. Everybody likes them.


Liberal-Societist (LSP) + SocDem (SocDP) Coalition (8 + 6 = 14 seats)
Ideology: "Markets can be fun if nobody starves!"
Role: Pushes for tradable discretionary points (but only for luxuries, never survival goods).
Most Extreme goal: is to abolish Body and Behavioral Stability Goods category and include it in Discretionary Goods to allow a freer market. 


Party of The Military Servicemen and Patriotic Duty (MSPD) (4 seats)
Ideology: "We won the revolution, now give us nice parks and public transit."
Role: The veterans' party. They don’t care about ideology—they just want urban planning done right.
Most Extreme goal: Every street needs at least 5 green zones. 1 to separate lanes on the road, 2 between cars and pedestrians(1 per side), 2 between pedestrians and buildings(1 per side).

The Smaller Parties 

- Guardist Party (Vanguardist Marxists): Wants a "real revolution", complaining that USCE is abandoning the revolution and is comically evil capitalist bullshit


- Party of Anarchists of Entantha: Calls the Anarchocooperativists "anardictators" for not burning everything down. Mostly tolerated because they’re funny and have cool graffitis.

- The wENDesday party. They are gaining traction in 2010s by... proposing a weekbreak/weekend on wednesday to boost morale and productivity.

- Others: Anyone can start a party, so there’s a Fishing Rights Party, a Punk Rock Collective, a Beer Appreciation Party and a "We Hate Mondays" faction.
