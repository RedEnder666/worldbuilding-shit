The Entanthan-Concordian Trade and Monetary Accord of 1926
Preamble:
Recognizing the mutual benefits of peaceful economic exchange and the principle of sovereign self-determination, the Union of Societist Communes of Entantha (USCE) and the Republic of Concordia hereby establish this accord to facilitate international trade and foster economic stability between their nations.


Article I: Purpose

This Accord aims to provide the USCE with access to the global market for the purpose of acquiring goods and technologies not producible within its borders, essential for its development and the well-being of its people.

Concurrently, it aims to provide Concordia with a stable and growing export market for its goods and services, thereby uplifting its domestic economy and industrial output.

This engagement is strictly for international exchange and shall not be construed as an endorsement of the other signatory's internal economic system, nor shall it invalidate the foundational societist principles of the USCE.


Article II: The Concordian Dollar as Trade Medium

The USCE agrees to utilize the Concordian Dollar (CD) as its primary currency for all official international trade and settlement of accounts with external nations.

The USCE shall maintain a Central Bilateral Trade Commission (CBTC), which will hold and manage all foreign currency reserves on behalf of the Union.

All earnings in Concordian Dollars from USCE exports (e.g., raw materials, specialized manufactured goods, cultural products) shall be deposited into the CBTC's accounts.


Article III: Internal Firewall Mechanism
To prevent capitalist market principles from subverting the internal societist economy of the USCE, the following protections are established:

The Concordian Dollar shall have no legal tender status within the domestic economy of the USCE. It cannot be used to purchase goods, services, or labor from communes, cooperatives, or individuals.

The internal resource point system, as governed by the Resource Allocation and Equity Act, remains the sole medium for domestic distribution and exchange. There shall be no convertibility between personal resource points and Concordian Dollars.

The CBTC will function as the sole importer of foreign goods. Acquired goods will be entered into the communal inventory and distributed through the established resource allocation system, not through a market.


Article IV: Concordian Economic Benefits
In return for providing this stable trade currency, Concordia shall receive:

Preferred trading partner status for its exports to the USCE.

A guaranteed and growing market for Concordian industrial machinery, agricultural equipment, and consumer goods deemed non-detrimental to USCE societal goals.

Stability in the procurement of key raw materials and resources from USCE territories, insulating Concordian industry from supply shocks.


Article V: Duration and Review
This Accord shall remain in effect for an initial period of ten (10) years, after which it may be renewed, renegotiated, or terminated by either party with one (1) year's written notice.

Signed in duplicate at Johnson, Concordia, this 15th of October, 1926.

For the Union of Societist Communes of Entantha:
Ender Rakhnak, Delegate of the Commons Coordination Board

For the Republic of Concordia:
Simonson John Frederick, Secretary of Commerce
