Case File: UBSO-94-301 // NOVOYE POTEMKINO INCIDENT
CLASSIFICATION: EYES ONLY - LEVEL DELTA

TO: Director of Internal Security, Union Bunker Command
FROM: Investigating Officer [REDACTED], Union Bunker Security Office (UBSO)
DATE: [DATE OF REPORT, 2094]
SUBJECT: Final Report on the Neutralization of Hostile Command Structure at Bunker NP-7 ("Novoye Potemkino") and the Death of Scout Boynak Ender

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
On [DATE], Scout Boynak Ender (Scout #1) initiated unsanctioned lethal action resulting in the death of the de facto commander of Bunker NP-7 (hereinafter "The Subject") and the subsequent collapse of the bunker's command structure. Scout Ender was killed in the immediate retaliation. This action, while deviating from recon protocol, indirectly achieved the neutralization of a hostile, expansionist regime, securing a potential future asset for the Union and eliminating an immediate threat. Posthumous commendation and survivor benefits are recommended.

2. BACKGROUND:
Bunker NP-7, designated "Novoye Potemkino," had been out of contact since The Fall. Intelligence profiles suggested a high probability of authoritarian consolidation, potentially aligned with pre-Fall "Guardist" ideology. Scout Ender was dispatched for routine status assessment and contact re-establishment.

3. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS:

14:32 Union Standard Time (UST): Scout Ender makes landfall. Initial contact with NP-7 perimeter is established. NP-7 personnel operate under the mistaken belief that Scout Ender is an emissary from a fellow "Guardist" survival state.

14:41 UST: Scout Ender is escorted to the Subject's personal quarters (designated a "palace" by inhabitants). Security protocol dictates he is armed with a standard-issue sidearm.

14:55 UST: Scout Ender transmits brief coded message: 'guardists think we are with them, over'. This message confirms hostile ideological alignment of NP-7 command.

14:56 UST: Union Command transmits response: 'return intel, over'. Transmission from Scout Ender ceases permanently.

Approx. 15:00 UST: According to witness testimony (see Section 4), Scout Ender discharged his weapon four (4) times at close range, fatally wounding the Subject. Scout Ender was then neutralized by the Subject's personal guard (designated "Protectors").

Post-15:00 UST: The elimination of the Subject created a power vacuum. Factional infighting among the Protectors ensued, leading to the near-total liquidation of the command echelon. The common population, kept segregated, was not involved in the violence.

4. FINDINGS:

On Scout Ender's Action: Scout Ender's decision to engage was a clear violation of recon-only engagement parameters. However, analysis of recovered NP-7 logs and witness statements indicates the Subject's regime was actively preparing for resource-raiding expeditions, potentially targeting Union assets. Scout Ender likely identified an immediate, high-value threat and acted to eliminate it.

On the Outcome: The outcome—the decapitation of a hostile command structure—is strategically beneficial to the Union. NP-7's population, once stabilized, represents a significant resource and genetic pool. The cost was the loss of a highly skilled scout.

On NP-7 Governance: The regime was confirmed as a Guardist dictatorship. Resources were hoarded by the command echelon, while the general population lived under austere rationing and constant surveillance. The Subject styled himself as a divine-right ruler.

5. RECOMMENDATIONS:

Personnel File: Scout Boynak Ender's record is to be amended to reflect a Posthumous Medal of Communal Valor for decisive action in the face of a direct threat to Union security.

Survivor Benefits: Per Article 7 of the Post-Fall Resource Allocation Amendments, Scout Ender's designated survivor, [NAME OF PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND], is to receive a long-term discretionary points bonus commensurate with the strategic value of the asset secured by Scout Ender's actions. This is to ensure the well-being of his unborn child, a future citizen of the Union.

NP-7 Stabilization: Dispatch a Union Liaison and Security team to NP-7 to oversee the transition to a provisional council, integrate them into the Union resource network, and debrief the population.

Protocol Review: This incident demonstrates a need for updated engagement protocols for confirmed hostile bunkers. The "recon-only" mandate may require amendments to include provisions for "active neutralization" under specific, clearly defined threats.

OFFICER'S NOTE: Scout Ender made a choice in a moment of extreme duress. He traded his life to shatter a tyranny. The Union owes him a debt that can only be repaid to his future child.
