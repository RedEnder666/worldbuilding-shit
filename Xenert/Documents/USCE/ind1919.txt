Declaration of Self-Determination and Independence
The Union of Societist Communes of Entantha (USCE)
Adapted: 4th of April, 1919

To the People of Sechia, and the Peoples of Entantha:

We, the people of the Union of Societist Communes of Entantha (USCE), having long been subjects of exploitation, oppression, and neglect by the colonial forces of Sechia, hereby declare our inviolable right to self-determination, to be free from external dominion, and to govern ourselves in accordance with the principles of justice, equality, and communal solidarity.

We, the people, declare the following truths:

The Natural Right of All Peoples to Self-Determination
It is the inherent right of all peoples to freely determine their own political, economic, and social systems.
No external power, no matter how powerful or well-established, may claim authority over the lives of those who reject its governance. The people of Entantha have long suffered under the weight of Sechian colonial rule, a system that seeks to impose control over our lands, our resources, and our very identities.

The Tyranny of Exploitation
Sechia, in its colonial ambitions, has extracted our resources, exploited our labor, and restricted our freedoms for the benefit of its elites, its military, and its bureaucracy.
Our people have lived in constant submission to Sechian laws and decrees, which prioritize the needs of foreign rulers over the well-being of Entantha’s citizens.
No longer will we endure this tyranny.

Economic Sovereignty and Justice
The economic model imposed by Sechia is not one of mutual benefit, but one of extraction and inequality.
It has never been the goal of the Union of Societist Communes of Entantha to enrich foreign powers at the cost of its own citizens.
Our people, having forged their own path in the years since the fall of the old world, will no longer submit to economic policies that drain our resources, control our means of production, and hinder our progress.

The Right to Determine Our Own Future
We have fought for our survival through the fires of catastrophe, building our communes and our networks of cooperation, emerging from the ashes as a community bound by mutual aid and solidarity.
We, the people of the USCE, are no longer subjects. We are free to chart our own course—a course rooted in the values of equality, economic justice, and democratic governance.
We will not be dictated to by Sechian forces any longer.
