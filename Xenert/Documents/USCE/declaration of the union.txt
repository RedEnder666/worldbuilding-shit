Declaration of the Communes of Entantha
In Congress, July 7th, 1903

When a people, long divided by chains, rises as one — those once enslaved, and those once complicit — to reclaim the land from tyranny and lies, it becomes their sacred right and solemn duty to declare the causes which impel them to unity.

We hold these truths to be proven:
That liberty is not granted from pulpits nor palaces;
That all power derives from the commons, not from crowns nor clergy;
That no person is born to rule over another.
The Empire of Sechia, under which we have suffered has forsaken its duty to its subjects and its soul. It has scorched knowledge from libraries. It has decreed blind obedience in place of reason. It has yoked the divine as a leash for the masses, and in its silence toward our pleas, revealed its contempt.

It burned books and spared sermons.
It fed temples while villages starved.
It crowned madmen and called it holy.
It governed from above and listened never.
It chained the innocent in body and thought, sanctifying slavery in the name of gods who never spoke
And when we rose in voice, it met us with steel and flame.
No more.

We, the united communes of Entantha — native and settler, worker and thinker — declare ourselves severed from all bonds to the Imperial Throne. We are not its colony. We are not its flock. We are free people.

We establish the Union of Societist Communes of Entantha, not as a nation of rulers, but of federated cooperatives; not under gods, but under conscience and consensus. Let the new standard be equity. Let the new law be collective.
Let no tyrant rise again.
Let no man starve again.
Let no birth define a man again.
We do not ask permission.
We do not await blessing.
We simply are.

In unity,
For the victims of the past.
For the children of the Future.
