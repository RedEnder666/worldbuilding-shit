[Transmission start]

Flight 03:
"Surface station. This is Bunker Recon Flight 03. We see your settlement. Confirm your status. Do you require aid? Over."

Unknown Surface Station:
"Took you long enough, metal bird. A little 15 years late, choke on my ass, g-man!"

Flight 03 (Pilot 1):
"G-man...? Negative, Surface Station. The last pre-fall Commons Coordination Board was not in the bunker lists; engineers and workers were prioritized. Confirm your status. Do you require medical, fuel, or food assistance? You are the first ground settlement encountered. Over."

Surface Station:
"Not in the list? (background voices arguing: 'the fuck you mean not in the list??') No need in your help, metal bird. We've dealt with allat... Thanks for the diesel and seeds back then though. At least somethin’. Late guests."

(Pilot 2):
"The Board didn’t make the cut. Families and workers were and are more important. Bunkers in the urban zones, for the people in actual danger areas, you're in the middle of fucking nowhere, nobody nuked your ass, over!"

(Pilot 1, whisper):
"Shut up, Boynak. We’re supposed to be official here."

Flight 03:
"Surface Station, status confirmed. Primary aid received prior to attack. Additional aid not required. We request peaceful landing — no weapons drawn. Integration not under discussion unless you wish it to be. We respect your autonomy. Apologies for our delay; bunker exit was impossible due to high urban radiation. Over."

Surface Station:
"You wanna land? Alright, metal bird. Land by the east field. No funny business, or the goats get feisty! (laughter) Welcome to our 'Surface Station'. Always called it Vysotki here, city boy. Forgot your map or what? (laughter) Hope you've got an idea when the winter’s gonna end..."

Flight 03:
"We appreciate it, Vysotki. We do have a map.."
